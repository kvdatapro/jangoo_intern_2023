# jangoo_intern_2023
This repository will host presentations, projects and their code which were produced during the internship at JANGOO TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED as a Data Analyst. As an intern, I was able to use cloud data platforms like Snowflake, data visualization platforms like Tableau and Grafana. Moreover, I worked with complex data sets, used analytics and visualization to draw conclusions and present information vividly.
