To start working with Tableau, I needed some trivial data which could be used to plot basic graphs/charts. Instead of using a dataset found online,
I decided to ask the people of Reddit a very important question: How many cups of tea do you consume daily.

Here is the link to that question:

I got around 125 responses and plotted a bubble chart on Tableau using those responses.
